I am an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I enjoy using data to uncover patterns, support decision-making, and communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This portfolio showcases selected projects completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate and additional independent analysis work.
